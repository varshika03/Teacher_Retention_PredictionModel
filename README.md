<h3> About</h3>
This project predicts the likelihood of a teacher to leave her present school using various machine learning algorithms.
This website acts as a teacher administration system where the principal can signup and check stability of the school's faculty.
It also provides a way to add new applications and display them when the likelihood of the teacher to leave the school exceeds 80%.
